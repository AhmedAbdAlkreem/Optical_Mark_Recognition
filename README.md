# Optical_Mark_Recognition
In this project we work to know all the contours in the image and how to deal with specific part of image and splitting it
to work on it wihtout another part of image.

# Goals of this practice:
1) To learn more in detection of image.
2) Know what is the conturs in the iamges.
3) Specific the area of all the contours in the image.
4) Splitting specific contour and work on it.
5) Make edge detection and buring in the image.
6) Detect all the object need from image through contours.


 Before this practice you will learn more in detect object and make bluring in image and i hope that be useful.
